# Course Planner

-- Image place holder --
## Installation 
This is a container-bound script to a google sheet hosted on google. It is possible to edit gs code from apps script editor. However, we use [clasp](https://github.com/google/clasp) to to edit apps scripts locally to use git version control.
## Introduction
Course events are currently represented as a static markdown file in cohort's Github repo, which is inconvenient to access for reading or update. On the other hand, course plan is in a table format. So, The main idea of this tool is to have a tool which converts table input to calendar events and be able to update/publish them from your table planner. 
## Motivation
- Improve cohort overall experience.
- Improving on tooling skill as a part of any developer skill set.
- Trying out collaboration on a real project, with the help of Github projects.
## Tech stack
- Google sheets.
- Google calender.
- Apps scrip (using google script which is a superset of javascript).
- jsdocs.
## Roadmap
Check projects section.
